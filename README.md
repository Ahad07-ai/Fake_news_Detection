Fake News Prediction:
This project aims to detect and classify fake news articles using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning techniques. The system is trained to analyze the content of news articles and identify whether they are genuine or fake.

Features:
Text Preprocessing:
Removal of special characters, numbers, and punctuations.
Conversion of text to lowercase for uniformity.
Elimination of stopwords to focus on meaningful content.
Application of stemming using the Porter Stemmer to normalize words.

Machine Learning Models:
Implementation of classification algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, or Random Forest.
Evaluation of model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics.
Dataset: Utilizes a labeled dataset containing real and fake news articles.

Vectorization:
Converts text data into numerical form using TF-IDF Vectorizer for model training.
Deployment (if applicable):
The model can be integrated into a web app or API for real-time news verification.

Tools and Technologies:
Programming Language: Python
Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, NLTK, Re, Matplotlib, Seaborn
Workflow:
Data Cleaning
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Text Vectorization

Model Training and Evaluation
Steps to Run the Project:
Clone this repository.
Install the required libraries using pip install -r requirements.txt.
Run the preprocessing script to clean the dataset.
Train the model by running the train_model.py script.
Test the model on new data using the predict.py script.

Future Enhancements:
Use deep learning techniques such as LSTMs or Transformers for improved accuracy.
Enhance the dataset with more diverse and recent news articles.
Deploy the model as a web service or mobile application.
